Nonresponse rates are a significant concern in survey research as they can introduce bias and affect the validity of study findings. In the Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments of the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology, various aspects of nonresponse rates and adjustments are discussed to enhance the understanding and management of this critical issue. One aspect that warrants attention is the impact of mode effects on nonresponse rates.

Mode effects refer to differences in survey responses that arise from the mode of data collection, such as face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, self-administered paper questionnaires, and online surveys. These mode effects can influence both the likelihood of responding to a survey and the content of responses, thus affecting nonresponse rates. Understanding how mode effects contribute to nonresponse rates is essential for designing effective survey methodologies and implementing appropriate nonresponse adjustments.

Several studies have investigated the impact of mode effects on nonresponse rates in survey research. For example, Couper et al. (2007) compared nonresponse rates across different survey modes and found variations in response rates, with face-to-face interviews generally yielding higher response rates compared to telephone and online surveys. Similarly, Dillman et al. (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of mode effects and nonresponse rates, concluding that mode effects can significantly influence response rates and data quality.

The presence of mode effects on nonresponse rates can be attributed to various factors. One factor is the level of respondent engagement and trust associated with different modes of data collection. Face-to-face interviews may elicit higher response rates due to the interpersonal interaction and perceived credibility of the interviewer. In contrast, online surveys may face challenges in establishing trust and engagement, leading to lower response rates (Bethlehem et al., 2011).

Additionally, the characteristics of the target population can interact with mode effects to influence nonresponse rates. For instance, older adults may prefer traditional modes of data collection, such as face-to-face or telephone interviews, over online surveys, leading to differential nonresponse rates across age groups (Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2016). Similarly, individuals with limited access to technology or low digital literacy may be less likely to respond to online surveys, contributing to mode-related nonresponse bias (Callegaro & DiSogra, 2008).

Addressing mode effects on nonresponse rates requires careful consideration of survey design, mode selection, and nonresponse adjustment techniques. Researchers may employ mixed-mode survey designs to capitalize on the strengths of different modes while mitigating mode-related biases (Brick & Williams, 2013). Additionally, strategies such as adaptive survey designs, personalized invitations, and incentives can help improve response rates across diverse modes of data collection (Singer et al., 2014).

In conclusion, understanding the impact of mode effects on nonresponse rates is essential for ensuring the quality and representativeness of survey data. By examining the literature on mode effects and nonresponse rates, researchers can identify factors contributing to mode-related biases and implement effective strategies to minimize nonresponse bias in survey research.
